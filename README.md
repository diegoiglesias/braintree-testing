#Braintree Testing

Right-click context menu to fill form elements with Braintree's testing credit cards numbers. Currently Chrome only.
Basically it's a simplified version of [Test Payments](https://github.com/facundofarias/test-payments) but focused on Braintree.

Original fork of [test-payments](https://github.com/facundofarias/test-payments).

##Usage

Install the extension from the [Chrome Web
store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/braintree-testing/ejnobgjbngckmjfhhgieglmhddcgncil). After
installation, just right-click on any editable item on the page and you'll see the
Braintree Testing submenu. Click an item there, and it will be inserted into the
editable field.


##Features

* Fast access to Braintree test payment data: Successful and Unsuccessful credit cards numbers
* Works on input fields, text areas, content editable DIVs
* Works on multi-frame pages, but only if they are from the same domain
* Only works in Chrome
* Tiny overhead per page (<1k), no 3rd party library dependencies, completely passive, so it does not interfere with your web app execution in any way
